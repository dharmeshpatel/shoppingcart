Thanks for downloading shoppingCart.

To install it, make sure you have Python 2.5 or greater and `python-setuptools` module is installed.
Then run this command from the command prompt:

    python setup.py install
    
OR you can also install it using `easy_install` command:

    easy_install shoppingCart

AS AN ALTERNATIVE, you can just copy the entire "shoppingCart" directory to Python's
site-packages directory, which is located wherever your Python installation
lives. Some places you might check are:

    /usr/local/lib/python2.6/dist-packages (Unix, Python 2.6)
    /usr/lib/python2.5/site-packages (Unix, Python 2.5)
    C:\\PYTHON\site-packages         (Windows)

For more detailed instructions, see docs/source/intro/installation.txt.
